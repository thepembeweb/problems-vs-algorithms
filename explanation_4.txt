Analysis

This algorithm sorts the array in-place in a single traversal and also it keeps 
track of location of index of last ordered 0, and first ordered 2 Mid index 
keeps track of how many elements have been checked in array.

Time complexity: The time complexity is linear O(n) because it has one for-loop 
that iterates from 1 to n which results in a running time grows directly in 
proportion to n. 

Space complexity: The space complexity is constant O(1) because, by sorting the 
array in-place, the algorithm maintains the same total size of new variables 
allocated to memory during runtime, regardless of input size.

Analysis

This algorithm uses the trie data structure to implement an HTTPRouter like 
you would find in a typical web server.

Time complexity: The time complexity of RouteTrie find and insert function 
is linear O(n) where n is the length of path_list because it has one 
for-loop that iterates from 1 to n which results in a running time grows 
directly in proportion to n. 

Space complexity: The space complexity is linear O(n) where n is the length 
of path_list because the size of the underlying array scales proportionally 
to the length of the path_list.

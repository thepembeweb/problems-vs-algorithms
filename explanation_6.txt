Analysis

This algorithm uses two variables to keep track of the maximum and minimum 
values as it goes through a single traversal the array.

Time complexity: The time complexity is linear O(n) because it has one for-loop 
that iterates from 1 to n which results in a running time grows directly in 
proportion to n. 

Space complexity: The space complexity is constant O(1) because the algorithm 
maintains the same total size of new variables allocated to memory during runtime, 
regardless of input size.
